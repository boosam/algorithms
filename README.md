## Project Structure
This repo is structured to align to each project.  Inside the bi-weekly project folder
there will be a README.md file which will provide a brief overview of the project and any special
instructions.

The structure of this repo will be:
* <week_num>-algorithm
  * \<language of solution\>
    * \<person or team\>
      * README on how to run project
  * README.md about the algorithm and pertinent info for this week's project
  
So, for example:
* 1-random_search
  * Erlang
    * Joel
       * README.md
       * docker
         * Dockerfile
       * src
         * ...source files...
